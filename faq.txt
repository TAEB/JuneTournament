Wait! Isn't the NetHack tournament in <em>November</em>?
Why yes, <a href="http://nethack.devnull.net/">the devnull tournament</a> is in November. One tournament a year is too few. And competition makes all participants better, right? That is, competition between tournaments <em>and</em> players in each tournament.

Who is running this?
Eidolos of irc.freenode.org #nethack. Posts on rec.games.roguelike.nethack as Shawn M Moore. In general a wonky guy. You can contact him at <a href="mailto:sarNetak@gmHackail.com">sarNetak@gmHackail.com</a> (but do remove the name of the game we play)
